 allen-p_22. column=content:body, timestamp=2024-06-05T02:40:53.222, value=Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same\x0Alevel of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You\x0Asay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I\x0Ajust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost\x0Awas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we\x0Acan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90\x0Aper sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the\x0Atrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.\x0ARichard Morgan\x0AManager, Green Building Program\x0AAustin Energy\x0A721 Barton Springs Rd.\x0AAustin, TX 78704-1194\x0APh. 512.505.3709\x0AFax 512.505.3711\x0Ae-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com\x0A\x0A\x0A-----Original Message-----\x0AFrom: Allen, Phillip K. [mailto:Phillip.K.Allen@ENRON.com]\x0ASent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM\x0ATo: Morgan, Richard\x0ASubject:\x0A\x0A\x0ARichard,\x0A\x0AI spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with\x0ASIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can\x0Adecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints\x0Acompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with\x0A8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.\x0A\x0AI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that\x0Ais also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of\x0A$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within\x0Athat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built\x0Ahouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a\x0Aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same\x0Aenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to\x0Aa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.\x0AThat would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional\x0Acosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?\x0ADo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help\x0Ame construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from\x0AWink with Premier based on you reference.\x0A\x0AThank you for your help.\x0A\x0APhillip Allen\x0Apallen@enron.com\x0A713-853-7041\x0A\x0A\x0A**********************************************************************\x0AThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\x0Amay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\x0Aintended recipient (s).

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\x0A\x0AAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.

Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.\x0A\x0ACheers\x0AKirk\x0A---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 11/23/2001 11:06 AM ---------------------------\x0A\x0A\x0Aann.s.chen@accenture.com on 11/20/2001 09:14:57 PM\x0ATo:\x09<Kmcdani@enron.com>\x0Acc:\x09donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com \x0ASubject:\x09SMEs for expert stories\x0A\x0A\x0AHello Kirk --\x0A\x0AHope you are doing well!\x0A\x0AJust wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of\x0Aproducint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be\x0Aobtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you\x0Afor your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:\x0A\x0ANumber of SMEs needed:  10\x0ANumber of expert stories: 20-25\x0ACharacteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a\x0Amix of structurers, originators and traders\x0A\x0A\x0AI've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will\x0Afollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main\x0Adifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of\x0A11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with\x0Athem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at\x0Aleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.\x0A\x0A(11/26-11/28)\x0A                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs\x0A(11/28-11/30)\x0A                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding\x0Athe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to\x0Adiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.\x0A(12/3-12/6)\x0A               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we\x0Aneed and where they can provide stories.\x0A                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the\x0Astories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video\x0Ashoot.\x0A                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.\x0A                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to\x0ASMEs\x0A(12/10-12/12)\x0A                          --Video shoot\x0A\x0APlease let me know if you have any questions.\x0A\x0AThanks,\x0AAnn\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0AThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\x0Aprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

 allen-p_73. column=content:body, timestamp=2024-06-05T02:40:53.152, value=Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\x0A\x0AI have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\x0A\x0AIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills\x0A\x0APhillip.K.Allen@enron.com wrote:\x0A\x0A> Jim,\x0A>\x0A> Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\x0Aof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\x0As of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\x0Aceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\x0A of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\x0A of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\x0Arators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\x0As a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\x0Aock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\x0Ares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\x0An several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\x0Aat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\x0Af Enron Corp. common stock.\x0A\x0AThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\x0A  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\x0A"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\x0Actions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\x0At apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=\x0Aution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=\x0Ament will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\x0A\x0AThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\x0Ais the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\x0Ahe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=\x0Aue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\x0Ag price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\x0Ament, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=\x0A  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\x0A share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\x0Abeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\x0Ap. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\x0Action 6.3.\x0A\x0AThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\x0A distribution under each of the three interpretations:\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0ASection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\x0A\x0ANumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\x0Aes\x0ARelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\x0APhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\x0A10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\x0AValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\x0ACurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\x0ADistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\x0A\x0AI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\x0Aadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\x0A.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\x0Aa hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\x0A =20\x0A\x0AIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\x0A same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\x0Aer.\x0A\x0ASincerely,\x0A\x0A\x0APhillip Allen   =20\x0A=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09

 allen-p_84. column=content:body, timestamp=2024-06-05T02:40:52.953, value=For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \x0A\x0ASection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\x0A\x0AAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \x0A\x0A      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\x0A
