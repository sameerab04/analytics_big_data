The bias/fairness results from the analysis on the all_crime model with respect to median income reveal significant variations in model performance across different income groups. The overall mean squared error (MSE) across all groups is approximately 15.79, which provides a baseline for evaluating the fairness of the model. However, when breaking down the MSE by income groups:

Group 0 (Lowest income) experiences the highest error rate at about 21.14, suggesting that the model's predictions are least accurate for this group.
Group 4 (Highest income) sees the lowest error rate at approximately 6.75, indicating better prediction accuracy for higher income areas.
Groups 1, 2, and 3 have varying degrees of prediction error, ranging from 8.10 to 12.34, which are below the average but not as low as for the highest income group.
These discrepancies might be indicative of underlying biases in the data or model, where factors influencing crime rates in lower-income areas are either underrepresented or differently patterned compared to higher-income areas. This variance in MSE across income brackets can lead to unfair or biased outcomes in predictive policing or resource allocation, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities. Such results emphasize the need for corrective measures in model training or data representation to ensure more equitable outcomes across different socioeconomic groups.
