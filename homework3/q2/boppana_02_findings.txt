Top Crime Blocks: The top blocks for crime events over the last three years are high-traffic and commercial areas, indicating a correlation between dense population or business presence and higher crime rates.

Highly Correlated Beats: Pairs of beats with extremely high correlation in crime events suggest shared socio-economic conditions or geographic proximity. Verifying adjacency through geographic mapping is necessary for these pairs.

Crime Rate Differences by Mayoral Term: There is a statistically significant difference in crime counts between the terms of Mayor Daley and Mayor Emanuel, with Daleyâ€™s term showing higher crime rates. This disparity may be attributed to different policing strategies, socio-economic factors, and policy implementations during their respective administrations.
