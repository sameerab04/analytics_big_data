The models evaluated on a test set of only violent crimes exhibited slightly better performance metrics compared to their training on all crimes. This improvement, particularly noted in Linear Regression, suggests that violent crimes may exhibit more consistent or distinctive patterns, which these models can capture more effectively. The decrease in RMSE and increase in R^2 values across all models indicate a higher accuracy and a better explanation of the variance when focusing on violent crimes. This suggests that different crime types might benefit from tailored models, potentially enhancing predictive accuracy and providing more targeted insights for law enforcement strategies.
