The crime statistics by day of the week, hour of day, and month, as depicted in the histograms, provide valuable insights into patterns of criminal activity.

Day of the Week: The histogram reveals a gradual increase in crime rates from Monday, peaking on Friday, and then a sharp decrease during the weekend. This trend might be associated with increased social activities and gatherings that typically happen towards the end of the workweek.

Hour of Day: The histogram shows a significant dip in crimes during the early morning hours, with a sharp rise starting from around 6 AM, peaking between 3 PM and 6 PM. This pattern may reflect the typical daily routine where streets are busier during daylight and early evening hours, providing more opportunities for crimes to occur.

Month of the Year: The crime rate starts moderately high in January, peaks around mid-year in June, and again in August, followed by a sharp decline towards the end of the year. The mid-year peak might correlate with summer activities when more people are outdoors, while the decline in colder months could be due to fewer people outside, thereby reducing opportunities for street crimes.

These temporal patterns could be crucial for law enforcement for strategic planning and resource allocation, ensuring enhanced patrolling and preventive measures during peak crime times.
